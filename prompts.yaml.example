# Example Prompt Configuration File for agent-workshop Pre-built Agents
#
# This file demonstrates how to customize prompts for pre-built agents.
# Copy this file to 'prompts.yaml' in your project root and customize as needed.
#
# Usage:
#   from agent_workshop.agents.validators import DeliverableValidator
#   from agent_workshop import Config
#
#   # Automatically loads prompts.yaml if present
#   validator = DeliverableValidator(Config())
#
#   # Or specify config file explicitly
#   validator = DeliverableValidator(Config(), config_file="custom-prompts.yaml")
